# TMP106 - NMEA 2000 temperature sensor module

This project provides a 
[hardware design](./hardware/)
and associated
[firmware](./firmware/)
for an NMEA 2000 six channel temperature sensor module.

There is also a
[user manual](./user/README.md)
for a device built using these two components.

**TMP106** is a specialisation of
[NOP100](https://www.github.com/preeve9534/NOP100).
